# This file will identify the files that are included when updating the ConstructRuntime project in NaturalONE from the ConstructRuntime.zip file.
# This file needs to be kept in-sync with .construct file that indicates the current shipped version.
#
# Each line represents a different runtime version (never remove old version lines in case the customer is updating multiple versions).
#
# The line format is: runtime.version=n[;folder/sub-folder/file.ext,...] where n is the version number and [] is optional.
#   Folder entries indicate all children will be included.
#   No entries represents all files will be included.
#
# e.g. runtime.version=4
# e.g. runtime.version=5;Natural-Libraries/Construct-Runtime/SRC,Natural-Libraries/Construct-Runtime-Extension/SRC/CD-HELP.NSN
